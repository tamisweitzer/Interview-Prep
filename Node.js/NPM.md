# npm 

## npm init

Running `npm init` will initialize an application and create a package.json file. 

## npm install 

- Running `npm install <package>` will download and install the package specified. 
- Running just `npm install` will tell npm to look inside the `package.json` folder and download all necessary packages. 

## --save and --save-dev Flags 
 - `--save` is used when the package needs to be bundled with the dist version of the app
 - `--save-dev` is used when the package is only needed for development.
